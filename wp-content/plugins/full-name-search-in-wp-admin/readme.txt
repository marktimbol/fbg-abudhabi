User First Name / Full Name Search In WP-admin plugin which empowers users search with no hassles.

== Description ==


By default WordPress in WP-admin allows users to search only by complete username or full email id.

But what if you want to search user by first name or last name or both. What if you want to search by entering only partial 
email address or username, you cannot do it as by default WordPress do not come with this feature.
Above limitation motivated me to develop a plugin which could perform search based 
on full-name , first-name, last-name, email and username.
“User First Name / Full Name Search In WP-admin” Plugin that allows admin to search user much more deeply and 
overcomes the limit possessed by WordPress.

Note :- This plugin is inspired from "Improved user search in backend" plugin.
